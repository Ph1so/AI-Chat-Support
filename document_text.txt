Lexington High School
Program of Studies
Grades 9-12

2024-2025



Lexington High School, 251 Waltham Street, Lexington, Massachusetts 02421

Principal’s Message 

Dear LHS Students,

The purpose of this LHS Program of Studies is to help you and your caregivers understand and make choices from among the wide range of courses available at Lexington High School. Our focus and work over the past three years has been to review, revise, and further diversify our elective opportunities for students. We have made adjustments to a number of course requirements to broaden student access. The point is to provide students with more equitable access to high-interest and rigorous curricular offerings at LHS.  This goal is a work in progress, and I am proud of the work accomplished to-date while also acknowledging that more work needs to occur.
Over the course of February, you will discuss recommended courses with your teachers, parents/guardians, and counselor. As important, you will be discussing and exploring your interests and hopefully challenging yourself so that the courses you select help you to further develop the key academic and life skills you need for the world beyond high school. Make no mistake, this pandemic has given all of you a crash course in the life skills and dispositions you need beyond school that will serve you all well. In March, you will identify the elective courses you wish to take using the online student portal.  Also in March, you will schedule an individual meeting with your counselor to review your course recommendations and requests and to discuss your choices. 
The goal of this process is to give you multiple opportunities to discuss and engage in reflection on the direction of your academic career at LHS. The course process takes planning and reflection and should be taken seriously. Be honest with the assessment of your abilities, time constraints, and interests. Ask questions and seek out the advice and guidance of the adults in your life, be they your parents, teachers, administrators, or counselors. The key is to develop a course load that challenges you while also allowing you to develop your current interests and abilities and try new areas to stimulate new interests. An important consideration as you navigate this process is to find the balance between the rigor of the classroom and the other activities in which you engage outside of the classroom. Finding that realistic balance remains essential to your success and well-being as you progress through high school. 
Please know that our course offerings, school-wide expectations, educational goals and objectives, graduation requirements, as well as our LHS policies are grounded in our desire to help you gain confidence in who you are as a learner and as a person. We will work with you to identify your strengths as well as any supports you need as you navigate through high school. While the course selection process ultimately is yours, please know that you are not alone as you make these important decisions. You all have much to be proud of from this year and my hope is that this experience will help you with the educational decisions you make for the next school year.  
Sincerely,

Andrew Baker – Interim Principal

This LHS Program of Studies is published under the assumption that the school will receive requisite funding from the town in order to support the program described herein. Changes, including reductions or additions, may result in response to a revenue shortfall, to newly identified needs, or to modifications that may be part of the annual planning process. We will do the best we can to publicize such changes in a timely manner.
General Information
Before making course requests, students and caregivers should read the general information in this guidebook, particularly the sections that describe program sequences. High school students and their parents/guardians should carefully review the sections on academic and graduation requirements. While school personnel will make every effort to assist students, the final responsibility for meeting course and credit requirements for promotion and graduation rests with students and their parents/guardians.

Student schedules are made following an advisement period (described in the Course Recommendation/Request Process & Academic Advising section) and with thoughtful level recommendations from teachers. After schedules are made available to students, we make every effort not to make changes to major courses or elective classes, unless extenuating circumstances present. Requests for changes during the add/drop period will be considered by the student’s team and enacted when possible and appropriate. As part of the master scheduling process, we do not honor teacher changes or requests for placement in specific sections of a course. Once the school year has begun, changes to a different teacher are allowed only when a student has a compelling reason and it is determined that the serious nature of the circumstances warrants a change

Accreditation Statement
Lexington High School is accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges, Inc., a non-governmental, nationally recognized organization whose affiliated institutions include elementary schools through collegiate institutions offering post-graduate instruction.

Accreditation of an institution by the New England Association indicates that it meets or exceeds criteria for the assessment of institutional quality periodically applied through a peer group review process. An accredited school or college is one which has available the necessary resources to achieve its stated purposes through appropriate educational programs, is substantially doing so, and gives reasonable evidence that it will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. Institutional integrity is also addressed through accreditation.

Accreditation by the New England Association is not partial, but applies to the institution as a whole. As such, it is not a guarantee of the quality of every course or program offered, or the competence of individual graduates. Rather, it provides reasonable assurance about the quality of opportunities available to students who attend the institution.

Lexington Public Schools Mission Statement
Joy in learning; curiosity in life; and compassion in all we do. 
The words were carefully chosen and intentional—joy over happiness; curiosity over achievement; and compassion over empathy. The word “joy” cultivates a sense of lasting inner peace that emanates from the individual; while happiness is fleeting and externally motivated. The word “curiosity” evokes a sense of wonderment that leads to deep intellectual engagement and attainment of knowledge and skills; while achievement evokes a superficial level of success, like getting a good grade or a perfect score. The word “compassion” extends beyond empathy, imploring us to not just feel, but to act on our sympathies and do something to improve the lives of others. In just twelve simple yet powerful words, we convey in our mission all that we aspire to do each day in the Lexington Public Schools. 
Lexington Public Schools Core Values 
1. We all Belong: We are inclusive of all people, and we embrace and serve one another. We are dedicated to working toward mutual understanding of all cultures, backgrounds, identities, ideas, beliefs, learning styles, and abilities that are different from our own. In our community, we all bring unique skills, perspectives, and experiences. We create a safe and supportive learning environment when we work to ensure that everyone is honored and respected. 
2. Use Your Mind: To learn and grow, we must continually seek new knowledge, think critically, know how to process information and apply skills to new situations. We seek out other points of view and work to understand the perspective of others. We recognize that all learning requires failure and making mistakes. We grow from these experiences and strive to continually challenge ourselves to our highest ability. 
3. Be Curious and Have Fun: Joyful learning is fueled by an inquisitive mindset, a questioning attitude, and an imaginative, playful spirit. Mastery of facts and skills is not enough. Active inquiry, application of skills, good humor, and productive struggle are the hallmarks of deep, lifelong learning 
4. Care for Yourself and Others: We nurture empathy and compassion for one another and care for our own well-being and that of others. When we seek joy for ourselves and nurture our own mental, physical, and emotional health and well-being, we are able to share our gifts with others. 
5. Do Your Part: As members of communities, both small and large, we are united in many purposes. When we encounter challenges or conflicts, we work together with confidence and humility. None of humanity’s great accomplishments were done in isolation. Members of our community meet each other where they are and are invested in one another’s success. 
6. Be Courageous: Doing the right thing requires daily practice. When we act with integrity and moral courage, even our small actions can lead to big changes. We believe it is our obligation to serve and care for others in our local and global communities and stand up for just causes, even when it might be unpopular to do so. 
7. Embrace Your Revolutionary Spirit: We are pioneers and innovators with the power to make meaningful, lasting change. We take bold and thoughtful risks, and we do not shy away when it is our time to lead. We resist the urge to make changes for the sake of change, and we willingly embrace new ideas that hold long-term promise and help us grow. 
8. You are Enough: We are all, at this moment, on unique paths. Life is a personal journey that is our own and not to be compared with others. Everyone has moments of doubt. Persevere. There is no one definition of success. We get to define and redefine success throughout our lifetime.

Graduation Requirements
The Lexington School Committee approved the following graduation requirements in March, 1996. The required course credits in each discipline/department are referred to as course distribution requirements.

1. Credits required each year:
9th Grade: 27 (reduced by 1 credit in the 23-24 SY to reflect a PE sequence shift)
10th Grade: 27 
11th Grade: 27 
12th Grade: 26 
*Beginning with the class of 2027, 12th graders will be required to carry 27 credit to reflect a PE sequence shift 
*Unless due to mandated services, LHS will not create 9th-grade schedules containing more than 29 credits. 
2. Students must earn 104 total credits and fulfill minimum course distribution requirements. 
3. Students must perform 40 hours of approved community service.
4. Required courses: Students will study English, Math, Science and Social Studies during each of the four years. Exception: In 12th grade, LHS offers “Student Choice.” Student Choice allows 12th graders to opt out of one of the following three disciplines: science, mathematics, or social studies. Students who choose this option must enroll in a full schedule of 26 credits. In addition, they must have already passed the equivalent of three full years in the discipline dropped (15 credits in science, 12 in social studies or mathematics). Since there are semester electives available in mathematics and social studies, students could opt out of a semester’s worth of math or social studies.

5. Course Distribution Requirements
Students must accumulate the following number of credits in each department as indicated:
English: 			16 Credits
Science: 			18 Credits
Social Studies: 		16 Credits (including United States History)
Mathematics:			16 Credits
World Language:		8 Credits
Physical Education: 		6 Credits
Fine and Performing Arts: 	8 Credits
Health Education: 		2 Credits
Grade Point Average 
Lexington High School does not rank students. The grade point average is based on a four-point scale and encompasses all subjects in which a student has received a letter grade.

To calculate GPA, each letter grade is converted to a number on the 4 Point Scale (see below), and that number is then multiplied by the number of course credits. These products are added. This sum is divided by the total number of credits. The LHS GPA is unweighted by course level.

During a student’s freshman and sophomore years, the LHS GPA appears only on the Quarter 4 report card. Beginning in junior year, the LHS GPA appears on students’ quarterly report cards and on students’ transcripts.  
Grading Scale {4 Point Scale/Letter Grade} 

4.33 = A+ 		3.33 = B+ 		2.33 = C+ 		1.33 = D+ 
4.00 = A 		3.00 = B 		2.00 = C 		1.00 = D 
3.67 = A- 		2.67 = B- 		1.67 = C- 		0.67 = D- 
0.33 = F

Transcripts 
Students who transfer from other high schools will be granted LHS credit for courses for which they have received grades at their previous schools.  Transfer grades will show a letter grade and “Transfer” to denote that the grade was received from an outside institution.  Grades for those courses are not calculated into the LHS GPA.  A copy of the previous school’s transcript will be submitted along with the LHS transcript for purposes of college admission.  The Counseling Department will work with transfer students to determine credits based upon previous academic records.

Attendance Policy 
Please see the Student/Parent Handbook for information regarding the attendance policy and its impact on credits. 

Alternate Grades
Grade: N This grade on a report card indicates that a student’s attendance in a course has met or exceeded 5 absences in a quarter. 
 
Grade: P This grade is used in circumstances where standard grading practices do not apply. Credit is recorded. 
Grade: I  This grade indicates that the student must complete some assignments in order to receive a grade for credit.  In the comments section of the report card, the teacher will explain the reason for the “I” and set a timetable/deadline for the completion of the work that falls within the succeeding academic quarter. (For example, the teacher deadline for incomplete work in Quarter 1 must fall within Quarter 2, etc.)  

Course grades of Incomplete (“I”) which are not made up by the end of the following quarter (marking period) will be changed to the grade the student has earned based on their incomplete assignments, except in cases where extenuating circumstances such as prolonged illness or temporary disability prevent make-up within this time period.  In such cases the teacher(s) and student(s) shall arrange for a reasonable extension to complete work.  If grades of Incomplete (“I”) are not made up within this reasonable amount of time, given allowances for extenuating circumstances, they will be changed to the grade the student has earned based on their  incomplete assignments.

Grade: X This grade indicates the student has not received an academic grade due to extended medical absences. This grade does not receive credit.

Grade: W This grade indicates the student withdrew from a course in which he/she was enrolled for 26 (or more) school days.  This grade does not appear on official LHS transcripts sent to schools, universities and employers but is used internally to reflect a student’s course history. 

Grade: Q This grade indicates that the student audited the course and is not receiving credit. 

Summer School
Students may repeat a course in a pre-approved summer school course/program for which they initially received a grade of F or need to recover credit due to attendance. Pre-approval forms and a list of summer school programs are available through the student’s school counselor. Summer school courses and credit may appear on the student's LHS transcript with a grade of P but will not replace the original course and grade. 

Courses Taken For Credit Outside Lexington High School
All major subjects and other courses approved by the School Committee are listed in the Program of Studies. Non-transfer courses taken outside of Lexington High School will not appear on LHS transcripts with a few exceptions: pre-approved summer school courses or other courses taken for credit recovery. Courses taken outside of Lexington High School or in summer school are not used in GPA calculations.

Repeating a Course
Courses at LHS may not be repeated for credit with few exceptions. Introduction to Special Education may be repeated, and select courses in the Performing & Visual Arts may be repeated. Please refer to those course descriptions for further details.

Course Levels 
The following description is intended as a general guideline for students, parents/guardians, and college admissions officers. The individual course descriptions under each department heading can provide more explicit information regarding the nature of the courses and the types of programs available at Lexington High School. The prerequisite course listed with each course description is the strongly recommended background necessary for student success at that level; however, teacher recommendations take priority over the prerequisite.

All courses offered at Lexington High School prepare students for post-secondary academic courses of study.  

Please note: Across all levels, the pedagogy and practices in LHS classrooms include attributes from each of the learning environments described below.  They are a guide, not a prescription, to what teaching and learning might look like in our classrooms.

College Preparatory 2 (CP2) 
The course level is designed to meet the needs of a learner who thrives in a structured learning environment. Learners can expect:
A flexible pace that allows for repetition and practice
Review of essential concepts and skills from prior courses
New ideas introduced in their most concrete form
To investigate, analyze, apply concepts, and solve problems with targeted support
Some work outside class, typically up to 30 minutes per class meeting
To be supported in taking increasing responsibility for their own learning

College Preparatory 1 and College Preparatory (CP1, CP) 
These course levels are designed to meet the needs of a learner who thrives in a guided learning environment. Learners can expect:
A rigorous pace
Assumed mastery of most of the concepts and skills from prior courses
New ideas introduced using a balance of concrete and abstract approaches
To investigate, analyze, apply concepts, and solve problems with moderate guidance
Substantial work outside class, typically up to 45 minutes per class meeting
To take increasing responsibility for their own learning

Honors, Concurrent Enrollment, and Advanced Placement (Honors, CE, AP) 
These course levels are designed to meet the needs of a learner who thrives in an independent learning environment. Learners can expect:
An accelerated pace
Assumed thorough mastery of all of the concepts and skills from prior courses
New ideas introduced in their most abstract and theoretical form
To investigate, analyze, synthesize, evaluate, and solve unfamiliar problems with minimal guidance
Extensive work outside class, typically up to 60 minutes per class meeting
To consistently take responsibility for their own learning
AP courses follow a nationally-standardized college-level curriculum and often use college textbooks. CE courses adhere to the college-level standards of the higher-education institutions with whom we partner. In some subjects, Honors and AP courses may include an independent inquiry project.

*Honors Designation for ELA courses
Students and caregivers should note that the above descriptions do not neatly align with the “Honors for All” experience students will have in their ELA courses in 10th, 11th and 12th grade, especially with respect to homework, pacing and scaffolded support. Students and caregivers are strongly encouraged to read this FAQ on Honors for All ELA classes before analyzing the impact and experience of an English Language Arts on their overall schedule. 

Credit 
Credit allocations are listed in the course title description. Credit is typically allocated based on how many times a class meets in a block cycle and whether the class meets for a semester or full year. (For example, a course that meets 4 times per a cycle for the full school year receives 4 credits.)

Course Recommendation/Request Process & Academic Advising
Appropriate level placements are made in the spring for the following year by current teacher(s) based on the student’s performance and demonstrated abilities. These recommendations and assessments are intended to place students in courses where the pace, expectations and standards are appropriate to their needs and abilities. Teachers’ recommendations are made holistically. LHS aims to reduce student stress and empower students to make healthy academic choices. The course recommendation/request process and academic advising provide students the opportunity to consider overall academic rigor. Students are encouraged to take a challenging program, but also to be realistic about their commitments in and out of school. As students formulate their course requests, attention to the Program of Studies is essential as it contains information regarding prerequisites, course recommendations, and course expectations. 

As a part of the LHS comprehensive school counseling curriculum, each 9th, 10th and 11th grade student will have the opportunity to meet with their school counselor for a 10-15 minute Academic Advising appointment. 
The Goals of Academic Advising include:
Reviewing graduation requirements
Discussing student's courses recommendations/requests
Considering course recommendations/requests and their connection to future planning
Reflecting on the student's academic placements in relation to balance and wellness. 

LHS Scheduling Website 

See Timeline of Academic Advising (Next Page)






STEP BY STEP PROCESS OF RECOMMENDATION REQUEST AND ACADEMIC ADVISING


Student and teacher discuss options/levels for academic courses that require a teacher recommendation.
Teachers enter course recommendations (for courses that need them).
Student and parent/guardian discuss program choices for the following year, reviewing specific language in the Program of Studies, teacher recommendations, graduation requirements. 
Student enters elective requests in Aspen, indicating alternate choices for each elective in the “Indicate Alternate Courses Here” box.
During Academic Advising, the School Counselor meets with the student to review their schedule requests, as a whole. 
Placement Review Process
Course placements at Lexington High School are based primarily on teacher recommendation. These recommendations should be considered carefully, and students and families should consult with the teacher if there is a disagreement about placement. After consultation, if a student still wishes to take a course or level that was not recommended by the teacher, the student may request a “placement review” for this change to be considered. To do so, request a placement review form from the current teacher, complete the form, and submit it to the academic department office by the predetermined deadline. Students who do not submit a placement review form will not be permitted at a later date to request a change that would have required a placement review to be submitted by the deadline. 

The student’s request will be reviewed by a team of teachers including the Department Head, and the student will be notified of a decision by May. Because this placement review is an appeal process, decisions are final and no further appeals are available. Students who request a placement review into a higher level than recommended should be aware that LHS cannot assure that a student who has difficulty will be able to switch later to the originally recommended course. A space in the course may be unavailable, or available only if changes are made to other classes in the student's schedule. The above information about placements is for students who are already enrolled in the Lexington Public Schools. There is a different placement process for students who are transferring into LPS. Details will be provided when registering for school. Please note: the Math department section of this document contains further, specific information about its placement process. 
Course Changes
Lexington High School’s master schedule is created based upon the course requests of all students. The course request process helps determine teacher assignments, courses offered or not offered, room assignments, and the number of sections of each course. 

The course request process is a cooperative venture between the student, family, and school. In the majority of situations, it is expected that students will honor their course commitments even if they represent an academic challenge as the year progresses. If a student needs to request a change to their courses, due to an extenuating circumstance, these guidelines apply: 

Student-initiated course changes are not routinely allowed beyond the first 12 days of a course (add/drop period). Any changes at that time must receive school approval. Some changes may be impossible, or possible only if other changes are made in the student’s schedule.

If a student drops a course after twenty-five school days of enrollment, a grade of W will be entered into the student’s internal academic record. 
 
When a student changes to a new course, at the school’s discretion, grades from the original course may be transferred to the new course and will be considered in determining quarter grades and final grades.
 
Changes to a different teacher are not allowed unless a student has a compelling reason and it is determined that the serious nature of the circumstances warrants a change.
Summer Reading
Some courses in English, Social Studies, and Science have required or optional summer reading. These assignments are posted on department websites in June. Additionally, students will receive a form email (to their lexingtonma.org accounts) from the Associate Principal indicating English, Social Studies, and/or Science electives that require summer reading for which they have been scheduled. 
Independent Studies
Independent study course opportunities may exist in some departments. Please note that during Academic Advising you must choose a full course of credits. Only after in September will you be able to elect to request this course. Be sure to speak to your counselor regarding this request. Additionally, these guidelines apply:

Students may not use independent study in place of regular departmental course offerings.
Department guidelines must be met and department leader approval is required.
All independent studies are graded Pass-Fail.
Independent study participants must generate and sign a contract, to be kept on file by the department, that includes frequency/length/location of formal meetings and the number of credits that will be earned.
Independent Studies may be added at the start of the school year, once the completed and signed contract is submitted to your school counselor.  Contracts are available in department offices.
Special Education
Students are found eligible for special education services through the eligibility process per Massachusetts and federal regulations. Special education services are provided through the Individualized Education Program.
Admission Requirements For Massachusetts State Universities
Admission to the University of Massachusetts and the Massachusetts state university system is determined in accordance with minimum standards established by the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education (DHE). However, meeting the DHE's standards does not guarantee admission, since the universities consider a wide range of factors when making admission decisions. The rigor of the curriculum is strongly considered. When assessing academic achievement, course grades as well as grade trends are important, including course selection and grades in relation to the desired major. A strong senior schedule helps show the applicant’s commitment to higher education. 

Minimum GPA Requirement: A minimum grade point average (GPA) in college preparatory coursework at the end of the seventh semester is required for first year Applicants. The University of Massachusetts and other Massachusetts state universities require a 3.0 GPA for admission. For students whose GPA falls below the minimum, a provisional sliding scale will apply.Students and families should reference individual universities for more detailed admissions requirements. 

Minimum Course Requirements: Students must have completed the MassCore program of study in high school.  The list below outlines coursework requirements based on years of matriculation. 
	
	English: 4 courses
Mathematics:	4 courses (Algebra I & II and Geometry or Trigonometry, or comparable coursework) including mathematics during the final year of high school*
Sciences: 3 courses (from Natural Science and/or Physical Science and/or Technology/ Engineering), including 3 courses with laboratory work*
Social Sciences: 2 courses (including 1 course in U.S. History)
Foreign Languages: 2 courses (in a single language) Note: American Sign Language (ASL) is a foreign language.
Electives: 2 courses (from the above subjects or from the Arts & Humanities or Computer Sciences)
*The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education has approved Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles as a substitution for a required math or lab science course when applying to Massachusetts state colleges and universities. 
Admission Requirements For Massachusetts Community Colleges
The Massachusetts Community Colleges are committed to an open admission policy. Residents who have earned a high school diploma, GED, associate degree or higher have the opportunity to enroll in a degree or certificate program. Please note that admission to some programs is competitive or may require the completion of prerequisite courses, and some programs have additional requirements including specific deadlines. For more information, contact the college’s admissions office.

Concurrent Enrollment Program
What is concurrent enrollment?
In concurrent enrollment (CE) courses, high school students can simultaneously earn high school and college credit for successfully completing a designated "college-level" course. At LHS, these courses are taken on our campus during the school day and are taught at the college level by college-approved Lexington High School teachers. 

For the 2024-2025 school year, we are running a limited number of concurrent enrollment courses/sections in Science, Social Studies, and World Language. Our goal is to explore other courses/content areas where we can expand this program. Please see below for some general information.

What are the benefits of taking a concurrent enrollment course?
The benefit of taking CE coursework as a high school junior or senior is the opportunity for students to experience college-level work in a supportive high school environment while receiving college credit at a fraction of the cost of college tuition. Additionally, these college credits may be transferred to many other two-year and four-year colleges across the country. Transferability policies vary from college to college. 

Are students in CE courses required to pursue the college credit option?
No, since students who choose to take advantage of this opportunity must pay (a reduced fee) for college credit, they do NOT have to participate in concurrent enrollment but may still be enrolled in the course and receive high school credit. Whether the student takes the course for concurrent enrollment or not, the course expectations remain unchanged.

Which colleges/universities does LHS partner with for CE classes?
During the 2024-2025 school year, we are partnering with three different institutions:
Middlesex Community College (CE Physics, CE Astronomy, CE Environmental Studies)
University of Massachusetts at Boston (CE Latin IV)
Syracuse University Project Advance (CE Personal Finance)

What are the costs and eligibility requirements?
The per-credit rates vary by institution. Please see the course descriptions for each CE class for more specifics on cost and (where applicable) eligibility.
















English
The English program at Lexington High School is designed to improve all students’ writing, reading, speaking, and critical thinking skills. Students read literature from multiple genres, cultures, and times to inspire discussion and reflection about what it means to be human. Across grade levels, courses reinforce the skills and habits of mind that students need to be life-long learners. All students completing the 10th-12th English curriculum will receive an Honors designation on their LHS transcript. This model represents our commitment to providing all LHS students with an English learning experience that combines high expectations and high support. 

Students will:
routinely produce coherent and cohesive writing, use precise diction, develop topics with purposeful structure and organization, and write for multiple purposes and multiple audiences
approach writing as a process through rewriting, peer review, and revision
develop an interest in reading and learn to consume culture critically
think critically about what they read and the world in which they live
participate critically and thoughtfully in a range of collaborative discussions with diverse partners
practice fruitful and responsible collaboration in the classroom and across multiple online platforms
Given the rising prevalence of AI writing technology, such as ChatGPT, English teachers also talk with students about the strengths and limits of using writing assistance tools. AI-assisted schoolwork is not just complicating our work in English, however. This technology extends to other subjects and tasks, and isn’t going away. Accordingly, our approaches to assessment have to change and adapt. This is ongoing work. But there is nothing a “bot” can do which is more valuable than students’ development of their own voices, ideas, and insights. 

Summer reading: The summer reading list will be available online https://sites.google.com/lexingtonma.org/lhs-english-department/home after June 1. Some courses do not require summer reading, although we strongly encourage students to continue their reading practice over the summer. Some years may include a single title that all students will read. 

Note to Students Interested in Advanced Placement English Tests:
Students may opt to take the Advanced Placement English test at different points in their high school careers. Traditionally, many students have taken the test at the end of their junior year. Students may also take the test in May of their senior year, after taking any of the senior electives. Students must take the AP English exam off-site at a school that offers AP English courses. Interested students must contact the AP Coordinator at extension 69113 at the start of the school year.


Grade 9 – Requirement
1100 – Literature and Composition I 
4 credits
Level: CP
The purpose of this course is to help students become more effective readers and writers. To this end, students study literature from a variety of genres. Major works include The Odyssey, The Alchemist, Haroun and the Sea of Stories, Oedipus Rex, Antigone, Romeo and Juliet, The Hate U Give, Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, and a variety of short stories, essays, and poems. While students have the opportunity to write for a variety of purposes, they focus their attention on the expository essay. Students learn to craft better arguments by generating their own thesis statements, gathering and organizing evidence, and revising earlier drafts of their work. To further the development of their reading and writing skills, students study targeted grammar and vocabulary throughout the year. In addition, they complete the Capstone Project, a yearlong independent reading project in which they select their own series of outside texts and related activities. Developed and taught in conjunction with the 9th-grade World History course, this course also focuses on the development of study skills, self-advocacy, and time management. Students need to use all of these strategies, along with their reading and writing skills, in order to complete summative learning tasks in the spring. 

Grade 10 - Requirement
1208 – Literature and Composition II
4 credits
Level: Honors
This course continues the skill development begun in Literature and Composition I. In a challenging but supportive class environment, students will work on expository writing, reading comprehension, grammar study, and vocabulary acquisition. Works from the four major genres provide springboards for frequent and varied writing assignments, inquiry and discussion. Students may read from the following texts: Homegoing, Fahrenheit 451, Macbeth, Great Expectations, Persepolis, Slaughterhouse-Five, There There, Lord of the Flies, Interior Chinatown, and will explore the voices of authors who provide diverse perspectives on societal structures. Students will also read essays, short stories, and poetry, and support their reading with film and audio texts to further explore genres and themes. Academic writing assignments will require students to select an appropriate style and to analyze and express complex viewpoints. Creative writing assignments and essays are designed to develop each individual writer’s voice. Other writing assignments may include personal narratives, creative emulation, poems, reflections, audio essays, short stories, and plays.

Grade 11 - Requirement
1308 – American Literature
4 credits
Level: Honors
Throughout the year of American Literature, students can expect to write formally and informally in expository, argumentative, and narrative modes. In class discussions and compositions, students examine the breadth, diversity, and evolution of American literature within the unique context of the American experience and American values/traditions. This rigorous approach to the literature requires closely reading and re-reading texts to identify patterns, contradictions, and the relationship between motifs and larger themes/ideas. Applying critical terms such as tone, mood, theme, and irony, students will analyze texts and articulate the distinguishing features of each genre. Students will also learn different methods of critically interpreting the texts to produce argumentative, expository, personal, and narrative pieces of writing. In addition, students are expected to be active, engaged, and regular participants in class discussions. At the end of junior year, students will have produced a first draft of a personal/college application essay. 

American Literature culminates in an independent writing assignment in which they synthesize the themes of the course.

Readings will feature some of the following authors: Willa Cather, Kate Chopin, Ralph Waldo Emerson, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Nella Larsen, Jhumpa Lahiri, Arthur Miller, Toni Morrison, Celeste Ng, Henry David Thoreau, Edith Wharton, and August Wilson.

Courses Open To Seniors
These are year-long electives. In each course, you will be expected to read and write. Teachers and texts vary year-to-year. Be sure to pick the course that most entices you.

Readings include short pieces and excerpts by mostly contemporary writers.

1448 – Introduction to Black Literature
4 credits
Level: Honors
This course focuses on the foundational contributions Black artists have made to the cultural fabric of American society. Through the lens of art, we will study how identity is created and impacts our interaction with both literature as well as with society. It is hoped that, through exposure to authors and artists whose ideas and values reflect diverse backgrounds, students will appreciate not only the differences, but the similarities, among all people. This will be a discussion-based course predicated on specific norms the class creates, with an eye toward empowering all students to think critically about the lessons of race, history, and identity in the works we explore. Students will be exposed to a variety of authors presenting views on the Black American experience through drama, memoir, novels, short stories, music, poetry, film, and visual art. Taking a step back to study African oral tradition steeped in the aesthetics of performative story-telling, we will then go forward, studying the development of Black identity throughout American history through narrative, speech, song, poetry, fiction, and film. From Harriet Jacobs to Beyonce, Ida B. Wells to Audre Lorde, Langston Hughes to Terrance Hayes, James Baldwin to Childish Gambino, trickster tales to Key & Peele, Boyz n the Hood to Black Panther . . .there is something for everybody.

1468 – Film and Society 
4 credits
Level: Honors
Filmmakers are artists who make formal choices to convey meaning. With a focus on analytical and creative writing, this course equips students with the language of film literacy in order to evaluate the relationship between cinema and culture. Once students have mastered film vocabulary, they analyze classic and contemporary films in a variety of genres as well as put film techniques into practice through collaborative group projects. In addition to reviews, interviews, and textbook chapters, students read essays on film theory and history. This course aims to cultivate critical consumers and creators of media as we grapple with the role that cinema plays in challenging or perpetuating messages about gender, race, class, and sexuality. Films may include some of the following: Citizen Kane, The Truman Show, Rear Window, Parasite, Portrait of a Lady on Fire, Creed, Star Trek, Into the Spiderverse, Past Lives, Do the Right Thing, Lady Bird, Her, and Moonlight.

1478 – Journeys in East Asian Literature
4 credits
Level: Honors
At the heart of the philosophical and imaginative literature of East Asia lie a view of the self, of nature, and of society that are relevant to our lives today. In this course, we will examine these views in two different contexts. First, we will read and reflect on the literature and philosophy of the classical Chinese, Japanese, and Korean traditions, before their encounters with European civilization. Second, we will study Chinese, Japanese, and Korean stories and poems from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, in order to understand how East Asian societies have responded and adapted in the face of globalization. If you are interested in the outdoors, in Eastern philosophy and religion, in poetry, in translation, in art, in how not to be stressed, in transformation, in literature’s place in the world, or in the relevance of big ideas to one’s life, you will find something in this course for you. The course uses a variety of excerpts and texts, some of which may include Tao Te Ching, The Tao of Pooh, The Path: What Chinese Philosophers Can Teach Us About The Good Life, Analects, Mencius, The Heart Sutra, Junji Kinoshita's The Twilight Crane, a variety of short stories, Zuo Ma's graphic novel Night Bus, Yoko Ogawa's The Housekeeper and the Professor, and Kyung-sook Shin's Please Look After Mom.

Mathematics
Program Overview
The Mathematics Department offers a comprehensive four-year mathematics program whose goal is to enable all students to reach high standards and full potential in a supportive, academically focused environment. We seek to engage students in meaningful mathematics that stimulates curiosity and enjoyment, while providing a balance between skill development and conceptual understanding. Throughout our curriculum, we emphasize these eight Mathematical Practices identified in the Common Core State Standards and the Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Mathematics:
1. Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.
2. Reason abstractly and quantitatively.
3. Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.
4. Model with mathematics.
5. Use appropriate tools strategically.
6. Attend to precision.
7. Look for and make use of structure.
8. Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.
Computers and calculators
School-provided Chromebook computers are used frequently in math classes for various applications relevant to the curriculum including algebra and geometry software, spreadsheets, programming environments, and digital platforms.
Graphing calculators are another vital tool for math learning, so students in every math course need to have a graphing calculator. Lexington High School strongly recommends that all students purchase a Texas Instruments calculator from the TI-84 or TI-83 family. A calculator purchased at the start of 8th or 9th grade will be useful for class work, homework, and assessments in math and science classes through all four years of high school. Our school has a supply of calculators for loan to students who are not able to get their own due to need; see the LHS Mathematics Department web site for how to request one.

Course Progressions
Lexington High School offers integrated mathematics courses that are fully aligned with the Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Mathematics incorporating the Common Core State Standards.The core courses Math 1, Math 2, and Math 3 each provide a mix of topics from algebra, geometry, and statistics/probability. The aim of this integrated approach is to present mathematics as a cohesive whole, while emphasizing mathematical practices such as reasoning, sense making, problem solving, and modeling.
The following course progression chart applies to the graduating classes of 2025 through 2028. It shows only the most typical same-level math course progressions. Students may move to a higher or lower level when appropriate and when recommended by their teachers. Many courses have prerequisite grades in the preceding course; see the course descriptions for details. Course requests that involve skipping a year of content cannot be made without special approval through the process described under the heading “Math Placements and Placement Review.”


Math Placements And Placement Review
For students transferring into the Lexington Public Schools: 
Upon registering for school, you will receive information about whom to contact for a placement assessment.
For students continuing at Lexington High School: 
Math course placements are based primarily on teacher recommendation, which are guided by course prerequisites. Teacher recommendations should be considered very carefully, and students and families are expected to first consult with the teacher if there is a disagreement about placement.
In the following cases, students need to request a math placement by submitting a placement review form:
If you want to take a course at a higher level than the teacher recommends, after discussion with the teacher, submit a Math Placement Appeal Form.
If you are currently in an on-grade-level course and want to skip the next course by learning the content outside school (for example, to go from Math 1 in grade 9 to Math 3 in grade 10), submit a Math Placement Acceleration Form. Students who make this type of request are required to submit a plan documenting how they will learn and be assessed on the content of the skipped course.
If you have the knowledge to skip over an entire course and doing so will place you into a course so advanced that it is not ordinarily taken by your grade (for example, into Precalculus as a 10th grader), submit a Math Placement Extra Acceleration Form. Students who make this type of request will be invited to take a challenging honors-level assessment after-school in late March or early April to demonstrate their readiness to take an especially advanced course.
Forms will be available on the Lexington High School Mathematics Department website by mid-February, and must be submitted electronically by March 15. Requests after this deadline will not be considered. Placement review decisions will be communicated by the end of May, but may be contingent on end-of-year grades and/or summer work.
For students in 8th grade at Clarke or Diamond:  
Most students are placed into their math course for grade 9 by recommendation of their 8th grade teacher. However, certain course requests require submitting a placement review form, as follows:
Incoming 9th graders who wish to take Math 1, CP1 Math 2, or Honors Math 2 but have not been recommended by their teacher may submit a Math Placement Appeal Form. This form will be available on the Lexington High School Mathematics Department web site by mid-February, and must be submitted electronically by March 15. Requests after this deadline will not be considered. The request will be reviewed by the LHS Math Department, and a decision communicated by the end of May.
Incoming 9th graders who believe they are prepared to enter a course beyond Honors Math 2 should understand that this type of request is not encouraged by LHS, and granted only in very exceptional cases where a student already has advanced knowledge of the content of the course(s) that would be skipped. Such students must complete a Math Placement Extra Acceleration Form which will be available on the Lexington High School Mathematics Department website by mid-February, and must be submitted electronically by March 15. Requests after this deadline will not be considered. Students who make this type of request will be invited by LHS to take a challenging honors-level assessment after-school in late March or early April to demonstrate their readiness to take an especially advanced course. Decisions will be communicated by the end of May.

6640 – Roots of American Music [Not Running 2024-2025 - Rotates with Controversy and Social Music]
Music or Social Studies Credit
2 credits - semester course
Level:  CP
Prerequisite:  None
Duke Ellington.  Louis Armstrong.  Charlie Parker.  In the early 20th century, American music- jazz, blues, rock and roll, and rhythm and blues, took over the world.  What is it about our music that makes it speak to so many people?  How did this new music emerge from plantations to concert halls?  This class will explore how American music came to be, and then how it affected not just the pop charts, but the way the world sees America, and the way America sees itself.   The format of the course will combine listening, documentary footage, first person accounts from musicians, critics and fans, hands-on exploration, and critical and creative writing on jazz and pop music to build students’ understanding and appreciation of our musical birthright.  Themes throughout this course will be on how we listen to and talk about music from a critical standpoint.  Students will also explore New Orleans, Jazz and the Swing Era 1900-1950 examining the birth and growth of jazz and blues, which for a two-decade period, were the most popular music in America.  Students will also meet the early geniuses of the music, how music helped create the idea of the teenager and music’s role in defining American and African-American identity.
